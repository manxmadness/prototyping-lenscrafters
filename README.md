# prototyping-lenscrafters

Project for Physical Computing I at VCU Brandcenter

Problem
Lenscrafters has seen a decline in sales with the introduction of glasses mailing services such as Warby Parker.

Solution
Create a generic Lenscrafters brand in which the consumer can customize every element of their glasses. Custom frames can be picked up in 1 hour.

The Build
A website which allows a user to customize a pair of glasses or have one randomized for them, so that virtually, no two pair of glasses are the same
